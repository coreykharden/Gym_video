                    <p>The inspiration for Ground Monkey was due to the restrictions imposed on gyms during the COVID-19 pandemic with gyms needing to close their doors, many gym owners were needing to find a way to still provide a service to their paying members or risk losing their livelihood. With Ground Monkey's private playlist format, instructors have the ability to continue to provide valuable video content for their members, while still maintaining an easily organized curriculum. With the low cost of using Ground Monkey's service, the cost of running an online learning environment is minimal. The ease of use and constantly added features will make it a valuable resource for supplementing your students learning when not in class. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Ground Monkey is founded by Chris Carlino, one of the co-founders of the <a href="http://americangrapplingfederation.com/" target="_blank">American Grappling Federation.</a></p>
